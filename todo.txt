To get above stories done, we need engineering tasks. Engineering tasks are to do's for programmers

    -Bring in all options
- continuous integration (DONE)
- server-side testing (DONE)
- client-side testing

To do on current task
- make build fail when lint fails ->DONE
- Choose framework -> DONE
- make lint fail when test fail -> DONE
- Spike HTTP Server with NODE -> DONE

_ Integrate

FUTURE IDEAS
- Abstract test framework? (swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)

- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
