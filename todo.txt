WeeWikiPaint
In Agile, one technique is Minimum Marketing Feature (MMF) is sth that the market cares about.
Does not have to be money, It is sth that market cares.

For WeeWikiPaint: We build a collaborative, real time application.
Features
- marketing home page (DONE, deployed to heroku)
- single-user painting on home page
- collaborative painting page (very basic)
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting ?
- more collaborative features

User Stories (way of showing business process)
- "hello world" server (DONE)
- Serve a one-file homepage (DONE)
- Serve 404 errors for everything else (DONE)
- Do we want a custom 404 page (DONE)
- Marketing copy (Done deployed to heroku)
- Publish to Internet (DONE Published to heroku)
- Create Empty Drawing Area
- Draw one line(pre-defined)
- Draw a line in response to user mouse
- Draw a line in response to iOS touch
- Draw multiple lines / follow the drag
- Minify and deploy
---------------CLIENT SIDE TESTING------------------------
- Create empty drawing area
- Draw one line

To get above stories done, we need engineering tasks. Engineering tasks are to do's for programmers
Engineering Tasks
- Spike serving a file (DONE)
- TDD file serving (DONE)
- design work (DONE)
- Exploratory testing (DONE)
- Write end to end integration test (DONE)
- Write server launch code (DONE)
- Create a very simple HTTP Server (DONE)
- automated build (DONE)
- static code analysis (Lint) (DONE)
- Bring in all options
- continuous integration (DONE)
- server-side testing (DONE)
- Create a very simple HTTP server (DONE)
- Basic DOM test
- Create drawing area using Raphael
- Respect dimensions of enclosing div
- Factor out common elements in our client tests.
- Smoke Test  to ensure that our magic div is in our actual home page.
- client-side testing-------------
- Test drawing tool (Raphael?)
- Integrate into HTML Page



To do on current task
- Run testacular/karma from Jake Script
- make build fail when lint fails ->DONE
- Choose framework -> DONE
- make lint fail when test fail -> DONE
- Spike HTTP Server with NODE -> DONE
- Test-drive Server  -> DONE
- Modify build script to enforce NODE version (DONE
_ Integrate (DONE)
- Put homepage.html in a good directory (DONE)
- Get Testacular/karma running manually with one browser (DONE_
- Figure out best assertion framework (DONE, expect.js)
- multiple browser(DONE)
- automation
- Set-up client side linting options (DONE)
- Automatically check that we're testing against all supported browsers (DONE)
- Move testacular.conf.js/karma.conf.js to a better location (DONE)
- Unify our test file location configuration (it's curretly jakefile & testacular/karma.conf.js configuration)

- Make Jake Success more obvious (DONE)
- Make test look at testacular/Karma DOM (DONE)
- Insert elements into Testacular/karma DOM (DONE)
- Assert existing elements (DONE)
- Install jQuery (DONE)
- Get onLoad() working or not worry about onload (DONE)
- TDD Drawing Area
- Assert that Raphael has been used to initialize our div (DONE)
- Make test check different things for IE 8 and everyone else
- Figure out exactly what Raphael is doing on IE 8
- Modify Lint settings for client global variables

FUTURE IDEAS
- Add License.TXT (DONE)
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., firefoxx keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
-Remove Node Version duplication between package.json and jakeFile.js
- Fix HttpGet duplication
- Automated npm rebuild (Remove node_modules .bin directory from repository (and add to .gitignore) and npm rebuild in jake
- Ensure that every browser has same number of tests running

Notes:
-Nodeunit does not work properly on windows
