WeeWikiPaint
In Agile, one technique is Minimum Marketing Feature (MMF) is sth that the market cares about.
Does not have to be money, It is sth that market cares.

For WeeWikiPaint: We build a collaborative, real time application.
Features

- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting ?
- more collaborative features

User Stories (way of showing business process)
- "hello world" server
- "hello world" client
- support multiple features
- marketing copy

To get above stories done, we need engineering tasks. Engineering tasks are todo's for programmers
Engineering Tasks
- automated build
- static code analysis (Lint)
    -Bring in all options
- continuous integration
- server-side testing
- client-side testing

-Create a very simple HTTP server

ToDo on current task
- make build fail when lint fails ->DONE
- Choose framework -> DONE
- make lint fail when test fail -> DONE
- Spike HTTP Server with NODE
- Test-drive Server
- Modify build script to enforce

FUTURE IDEAS
- Abstract test framework? (swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Add License.TXT (DONE)
