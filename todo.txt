WeeWikiPaint
In Agile, one technique is Minimum Marketing Feature (MMF) is sth that the market cares about.

- more complex painting ?
- more collaborative features

User Stories (way of showing business process)

- "hello world" client
- support multiple features
- marketing copy

To get above stories done, we need engineering tasks. Engineering tasks are to do's for programmers

    -Bring in all options
- continuous integration (DONE)
- server-side testing (DONE)
- client-side testing

To do on current task
- make build fail when lint fails ->DONE
- Choose framework -> DONE
- make lint fail when test fail -> DONE
- Spike HTTP Server with NODE -> DONE
- Test-drive Server  -> DONE
- Modify build script to enforce NODE version
_ Integrate

FUTURE IDEAS
- Abstract test framework? (swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
